"""Self-extension — Jarvis writes a NEW plugin tool from a description and hot-loads it.

It asks the LLM to author a plugin file (TOOLS + HANDLERS contract), validates it
parses + imports, writes it to plugins/, and merges it into the live tool registry.

A plugin file must define module-level TOOLS (list) and HANDLERS (dict). Example:

    """One-line description."""

    HANDLERS = {"say_hello": _hello}

Rules: pure standard-library (or urllib for HTTP) only; no network secrets; handlers
take a single dict arg and return a STRING; tool names must be unique snake_case.
