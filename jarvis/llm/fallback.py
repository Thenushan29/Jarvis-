"""FallbackClient — wraps multiple same-family LLMClients for resilience.

Tries the active provider; on a rate-limit / transient error it transparently
falls through to the next provider (e.g. Groq -> Gemini, both free + OpenAI-compat),
then sticks with whichever worked. This keeps Jarvis up when one provider's daily
quota is exhausted.

IMPORTANT: all sub-clients must share the same message format (all OpenAI-compat,
or all Anthropic) since conversation history is built in that format. The factory
enforces this by only pairing same-kind providers.
